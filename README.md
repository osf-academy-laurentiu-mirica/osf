since I put in here the contents of my entire project folder it contains also some other files

MAIN file is 'OSF Academy.html', the other one [...old school] is an atempt to build it 'by hand'

On the plus side, I've been using some HTML/CSS/JS for some time now but on the other hand the only environment [aka Spotfire] is kind of a 'sandbox'.
I only heard of PHP, Node.js, Bootstrap & others but whenever I tried to implement them turned out that Spotfire can not use them.
Furthermore, Spotfire has a lot of JavaScript & jQuery under the hood and this makes it very difficult even to some basic js scripts - sometimes 
I can not even use EventListeners on some elements.


Anyway, I will try my best to use and apply as much as possible.

PS: whenever you have the chance to take a look over my result, I would apreciate any feedback!

Thank you!
